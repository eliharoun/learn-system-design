      overview: 'Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and inconsistent dependency. Denormalization is a database optimization technique that adds redundant data to improve read performance.',
      keyPoints: [
        'Primary key: Column or group uniquely identifying every row',
        'Foreign key: Reference to primary key of another table',
        'Functional dependency: Relationship between primary key and non-key attributes',

        'BCNF: Stronger version of 3NF for certain anomaly types',

      example: 'Normalized: Separate Users and Orders tables. Denormalized: Orders table includes user name and email for faster queries.',
      detailedExplanation: 'Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity by organizing data into separate related tables. Denormalization sacrifices some data integrity for improved read performance by storing redundant data to avoid complex joins.',
